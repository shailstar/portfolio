        Hi, my name is Shailendra Singh
      </h1>
      <p>
        I am enjoying the journey of exploring the programming world which I started on 15 march 2020. 
        Before that I had programming experience in c++ programming language because in college I took a project of building a robot. 
        After that I learned python by myself and gain some very basic backend knowledge in django.
        I started with developing a wordpress website for my client. On the basis of which I got my second project. 
        But this time I decided that I am going to build this website through coding. So I started learning HTML and CSS. 
        To add differnet kind of interaction and animations on my clients website I learned javascript. And Finally Biuld a website
        using python and django in backend and HTML, CSS and Javascript with some animation libraies like anime.js, tilt.js etc.
        I have also build some basic javascript project which use  open weather api.
        After this much of exploration I have decided to start my career as front-end developer. For that I have started learning react 
        framework.
